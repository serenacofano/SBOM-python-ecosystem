# SBOM Generation Tools in the Python Ecosystem: an In-Detail Analysis

This repository contains the dataset and the SBOMs used for the research presented in the paper ["SBOM Generation Tools in the Python Ecosystem: an In-Detail Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01214). The study focuses on identifying the causes behind **completeness** and **correctness** issues in SBOMs generated for Python projects.

The repository is structured as follows:

- [***projects***](/projects/) is a collection of synthetic Python projects created using different package managers.
- [***data***](/data/) contains SBOMs generated by the selected SBOM generation tools for each project.
